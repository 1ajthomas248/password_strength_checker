# 🛡️ Password Strength Checker (Python)

An IT/cybersecurity tool that analyzes a user’s password and provides detailed feedback on its overall strength.  
This project reinforces Python fundamentals while teaching practical security concepts like character complexity, entropy thinking, and password hygiene.

---

## 🔍 Features
- Evaluates password strength based on:
  - Length  
  - Uppercase letters  
  - Lowercase letters  
  - Numbers  
  - Special characters  
- Detects weak/common passwords  
- Provides clear, actionable feedback to the user  
- Outputs a **strength rating** (Weak, Medium, Strong)

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project is part of my journey into **cloud engineering, cloud administration, and cybersecurity**.  
It helps me:
- Refresh my Python skills  
- Build a strong foundation in security fundamentals  
- Create portfolio-ready projects to showcase practical knowledge

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level Overview)
1. User enters a password  
2. Program checks the password against security criteria  
3. Each check contributes to an overall score  
4. Password is labeled **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**  
5. Detailed suggestions help the user improve their password  

No external dependencies — built with pure Python.

## ▶️ Usage
Run the script from the command line:
python password_checker.py

The program will return:
- A strength rating
- A breakdown of what checks passed or failed
- Suggestions for improvement
